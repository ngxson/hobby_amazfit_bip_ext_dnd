- Find my phone
- Torch (flash light): swipe left to access (This app is built-in)
- Button to access Calculator (You need to install Calculator app separately)
- Music control: swipe right to access (This app is built-in)

**Note:** Flash light and music control functionalities are built into the program. You don't need to install them separately.

# HOW TO INSTALL

This app allows you to have 2 customizable buttons to launch apps. By default:
- Button A launchs app index 4 in your list
- Button B launchs app index 5 in your list

### How to change icon

You can replace res ID **0000** (big zero digit in orange) and **0001** (big zero digit in orange) in your watch's res file. The reason that I choose these two images is that we never use it anyway.

### How to change app

Buttons can launch app at index 4, 5.  
It is because these app **cannot** be easily reached. It will be useless to launch app index 1, 2 because it is easier to be reached.

**Attention**: You must also count HIDDEN APPS like alarm_edit. For example, your app list looks like this:

```
0. alarm_edit (this app is hidden)
----- page 1/2 -----
1. calendar
2. calculator
3. fitness timer
----- page 2/2 -----
4. animation for main menu (this app is hidden)
5. notes
6. HR chart
7. tetris
```

You want to assign **calendar to button A** and **calculator to button B**:

```
0. alarm_edit (this app is hidden)
----- page 1/2 -----
1. notes
2. HR chart
3. fitness timer
----- page 2/2 -----
4. calendar     <= Button A
5. calculator   <= Button B
6. animation for main menu (this app is hidden)
7. tetris
```
